# Delphi - Personal Website
*Delphi has been considered by Greeks to be the center of the world, as the site of the original omphalos – "navel of the Earth.*

Welcome to Joshua's corner of the internet.

### Manifesto
My manifesto for maintaining and updating the website

1. **Human** - AI will not be used in the development or writing of this website
2. **HTML** - Nothing can or will break
3. **Markdown** - Easy to write, read and publish
4. **RSS** - Manually updated with every new entry
5. **Open-source** - Free and transparent as it should be
